###What do you think about ParkMe and product?
I think ParkMe is a great product that a lot of people can benefit from.

###How would you make the product better?
I noticed on the parking lot detail pages (i.e. parkme.com/lot/<:lot_id>/<:slug>) that the 'Central Office Phone' number isn't shown by default.  A '+ 1 others' link is shown and has to be clicked to reveal the number.  They take up about the same amount of space, so I would change it to show the number by default.  That way users could get the information at a glance.

###How would you rank yourself on the following categories (1-10)?
Whenever I try to rank myself as a programmer I'm reminded of a video I saw of Bjarne Stroustrup where he said he would only rank his ability with C++ as an 8 on a scale of 1-10, which makes me feel like a 1 or a 2 in everything.

###Front-end Programming (HTML, CSS, Javascript) (HTML - 8, CSS - 7, Javascript - 4)
I want to be better with Backbone.js, which I've only made small projects with through online tutorials.  I'm fast with CSS3, but I know I would be even faster if I used LESS instead.  A lot of javascript I have written has been very functional, like focus on a form field after the page loads or convert the time to the client's local timezone and language.  I want to be better with jQuery and animation.

###Back-end Programming Languages (Python, PHP, Ruby, etc) (Python - 5, Ruby - 2)
I've been coding with Python for 2 years.  I came at it with a background in Java and C++.  I feel very comfortable in Python now, but I wish I was more of a Pythonista.  There is an atmosphere in the Python community to appreciate elegant code over just functional code.  I feel like I'm at a functional level, but I want to be at an elegant level.  I want to get better with Ruby, which I've picked up over the last month for Chef and Vagrant.

###Linux (5)
I was 17 when I got my first laptop (Dell Inspiron).  I immediately dual booted it with Fedora because I had been dying to try Linux and hadn't been able to have it on my own system until then.  I love it, but even though I've been using it for a while I know I could be better if I learned some more shell tricks.  I've never broken a kernel apart and looked at its base code.

###SQL (Postgresql) (3)
I have used ORMs to deal with SQL databases a lot of the time.  Django has the built-in ORM and with Flask I'm fond of SQLAlchemy.  I've only had to go down to the SQL to setup new databases and users. I have ran through a couple SQL tutorials and feel like I have a good grasp of what's going on conceptually in a SQL database.  I would really like to know more about optmizing a SQL database.

###Design (Photoshop) (4)
I like clean, minimal designs and I haven't strayed far from this.  I like most of the Bootstrap defaults and try to build on them rather than replace them.  I think this limits my designs and the types of layouts I create.  I've really only used Photoshop to touch up photos and/or resize/crop them.
